	   <p>
		 This is <b>Flaviviridae-GLUE</b>, a
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>GLUE</b></a>
		 project designed to support comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis of
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://viralzone.expasy.org/43">flaviviruses</a>
		 (family <i>Flaviviridae</i>).
		 <b>Flaviviridae-GLUE</b> contains aligned, annotated genome sequence data for
		 <a target="_blank" href="./website/viruses.html">flaviviruses</a></li> and
		 <a target="_blank" href="./website/paleoviruses.html">endogenous viral elements (EVEs) derived from flaviviruses</a>.
	   </p>

	   <p>
         Flaviviruses are small, enveloped animal viruses containing a single positive
         strand genomic RNA. Modern studies on these viruses began with the discovery -
         nearly a century ago - that the disease <b>yellow fever</b> is caused by a
         filterable agent and transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.
	   </p>


	   <p>
          Although humans are primarily dead-end hosts for maintenance of flaviviruses
          in their natural cycle, arthropod-borne flaviviruses are responsible
          for significant human and animal disease worldwide.

	   </h3>
       <hr>


	   <p>
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>GLUE</b></a> is an open, integrated
		 software toolkit that provides functionality for storage and interpretation of
		 sequence data. 
	   </p>

	   <p>
		 <b>GLUE</b> supports the development of <b>“projects”</b> containing the data items
		 required for comparative genomic analysis 
		 (e.g.  sequences, multiple sequence alignments, genome feature annotations,
		 and other sequence-associated data). 
	   </p>

	   <p>
		 Projects are loaded into the <b>GLUE "engine"</b>, creating a relational database
		 that represents the semantic relationships between data items.
		 This provides a robust foundation for the implementation of <b>systematic
		 comparative analyses</b> and the development of <b>sequence-based resources</b>. 
	   </p>

	   <p>		 
		  The core schema of this database can be extended to accommodate
		  the idiosyncrasies of different projects, and
		  GLUE provides a scripting layer (based on JavaScript) for developing custom
		  analysis tools. 
	   </p>

	   <p>
		  Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control system (e.g. GitHub) provides
		  a mechanism for their stable, collaborative development.
	   </p>
	   
	   

		   
		 <p>
		   Some examples of '<b>sequence-based resources</b>' built for viruses using GLUE include:

		   <li> 
			 <a target="_blank" href="http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>COV-GLUE</b></a>: 
			 A GLUE resource for tracking genetic variation in SARS-COV2.
			 CoV-GLUE contains a database of amino acid replacements, insertions and
			 deletions which have been observed in GISAID hCoV-19 sequences sampled from the pandemic
		   </li>

		   <li>
			 <a target="_blank" href="http://rabv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>RABV-GLUE</b></a>:

			 an analysis tool providing genotyping, analysis and visualisation of submitted FASTA sequences.

			 <a target="_blank" href="http://hcv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>HCV-GLUE</b></a>:
			 This GLUE resource aims to support analysis of drug resistance and vaccine

			 A database of HCV sequences and metadata from NCBI, updated daily and arranged
			 into clades (genotypes, subtypes). As well as pre-built multiple-sequence
			 alignments of NCBI sequences, it includes an analysis tool providing genotyping,
			 drug resistance analysis and visualisation of submitted FASTA sequences.

	   <a id="WhyGlueProject" class="anchor" href="#glueProject" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>What does building the Flaviviridae-GLUE project offer?</strong>
	   </h3>
	   <hr>

		 
 
	   <p>
		 
		  Flaviviridae-GLUE offers a number of advantages for performing comparative sequence
		  analysis of flaviviruses:


		  <ol>

			<li> <strong>Reproducibility</strong>. 
			For many reasons, bioinformatics analyses are notoriously difficult to reproduce.
			The GLUE framework supports the implementation of fully reproducible 
			comparative genomics through the introduction of data standards and the use 
			of a relational database to capture the semantic links between data items.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Reusable data objects and analysis logic</strong>. 
			For many - if not most - comparative genomic analyses, data preparation is nine
			tenths of the battle. The GLUE framework has been designed to ensure that 
			work spent preparing high-value data items such as multiple sequence alignments
			need only be performed once. Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control 
			system such as GitHub allows for collaborative management of important data items
			and community testing of hypotheses.
			</li>
			<br>


			<li> <strong>Validation</strong>. 
			Building GLUE projects entails mapping the semantic links between data items
			(e.g. sequences, tabular data, multiple sequence alignments).
			This process provides an opportunity 
			for cross-validation, and thereby enforces a high level of data integrity.
			</li>
			<br>
		
			<li> <strong>Standardisation of the genomic co-ordinate space</strong>. GLUE
			projects allow all sequences to utilise the coordinate space of a chosen 
			reference sequence. Contingencies associated with insertions and deletions
			(indels) are handled in a systematic way.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Predefined, fully annotated reference sequences</strong>:
			This project includes fully-annotated reference sequences for major lineages
			within the <i>Hepadnaviridae</i> family.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Alignment trees</strong>:
			GLUE allows linking of alignments constructed at distinct taxonomic levels
			via an ""<b>alignment tree</b>"
			data structure. In the alignment tree, each alignment
			is constrained to a standard reference sequence, thus all multiple sequence
			alignments are linked to one another via a standardised coordinate system.
			</li>
			
		  </ol>
